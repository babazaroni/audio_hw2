   SPI Slave Function Library tested for operation up to 25MHz SCLK
   frequency and all four SPI modes

This is a function library for applications needing to implement SPI
slave functionality. All four SPI modes are supported at clock speeds
up to 25MHz.


Known issues
============

   * module_spi_slave: Slave select line usage documentation still to
     be added. Slave active when SS line low, as is standard for SPI.
     However SS port is inverted, so apps must watch for SS port going
     high.

   * module_spi_slave: MISO port continues to drive final bit after
     output is complete, rather than being left in a high-impedance
     state.

These issues will be addressed in the next release.
